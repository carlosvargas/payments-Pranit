# Company Ledger

We're starting to generate a lot of revenue at Daily Pizza Img Corp. We have a lot of users
subscribing to our service that provides subscribers with tasty pizza pictures. Our accounting
team is overwhelmed with all the logins they have to manage to calculate our company earnings
every month. We'd like to create an in house solution to help them streamline the process. This
in house soltuion will display an aggregate of all our revenue streams in one place for our
accounting team.

## Version 1 Requirements

For our first revision we'd like our company ledge to have the following:

- A list of transactions in order of most recent
- Each item must display the following information:
  - Date and time of transaction
  - Amount
  - A description of the transaction
  - Which payment gateway was used
  - Which user the transaction was initialized by
  - The status of the transaction
- The list must be paginated

Our design team mocked up this as a reference:

## Version 2 Requirements

We're currently working with the product and accounting teams on version 2 requirements.
